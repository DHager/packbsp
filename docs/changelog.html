	<h1>Version 2.0.5</h1>
	<div class="release-date">Released March <sup>25th</sup> 2011</div>
	<p>This release marks the open-sourcing of PackBSP!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Added support for $ambientocclusiontexture</li>
                <li>
                    Removed dependency on jRegistryKey after it caused start-up problems for some users, in favor of a home-grown solution.
                </li>
                <li>Cleaned up codebase and build process for open-sourcing.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Known issues:</h2>
	<ul>
            <li>(Same as 2.0.4)</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="revision">
	<h1>Version 2.0.4</h1>
	<div class="release-date">Released Nov <sup>6th</sup> 2010</div>
	<p>This release is primarily small bug-fixes. Unfortunately,
	screening out non-used static-prop skins is still not working until I
	puzzle out more of the MDL format, sorry.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Feature: Tries to auto-detect the Steam directory from the
		Windows Registry.</li>
		<li>Fix: Issue where if the same file exists in the game
		directory and in the GCFs, it was being unnecessarily packed, even
		if the file content is identical.
		Now such "harmless duplicates" are ignored and not
		packed. (This is particularly important for TF2 maps using the old
		Swamp Pack assets became officially adopted.)</li>
		<li>Fix: Issue where model-skin paths contained an extra slash
		due to how the QC options where written prior to compile.</li>
		<li>Fix: VMTs legitimately provided in place of SPR files are now
		parsed correctly to find depended-upon materials/textures.</li>
		<li>Fix: Clientregistry.blob is no longer directly read, but
		instead copied to a temporary file to avoid conflicts with
		concurrent Steam operations. This can still fail if Steam is in the
		middle of updating or downloading game data, but the error message
		should be much clearer now.</li>
		<li>Fix: Upgraded to use HlLib 2.4.0, fixing an issue where HlLib
		could not extract from GCFs over 4gb in size.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Known issues:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>"Locked" variations of TF2 control-point hud
		icons (ending in _locked.vmt) are not discovered for
		team_control_point. This is due to hidden behavior of the TF2
		engine, and will require additional work to add "plug-ins"
		that can solve this in an extensible manner.</li>
		<li>Textures that are needed for custom particles are not
		detected. This will require more work to parse PCF files.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="revision">
	
	<h1>Version 2.0.3</h1>
	<div class="release-date">Released August 13<sup>th</sup> 2010</div>
	<ul>
		<li>Due to discovering an unresolved bug in model-parsing, <b>all</b>
		materials for a model are now packed, even if that model is static
		and some might not be used. This temporary workaround potentially
		increases the file-size of maps but does not run the risk of missing
		textures.</li>
		<li>Handles model-gibs (ragdoll and rigid) for non-static models,
		through parsing the .phy files.</li>
		<li>Handles models' $includemodel settings, to pull in shared
		animations and sequences.</li>
		<li>Support for special-case entities:
		<ul>
			<li>env_screenoverlay</li>
			<li>material_modify_control</li>
			<li>trigger_vphysics_motion</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
