<h3>What it is:</h3>
<p>PackBSP is a tool to help automatically
manage and pack dependencies in custom maps for games based on the
Source Engine by Valve Software. Please note that games which do not
use the central Source SDK (Such as <i>Left 4 Dead</i> or <i>Alien
Swarm)</i> are not yet supported.</p>

<h3>What you need:</h3>
<ol>
	<li>You need to have Java 5.0 or
	higher in order to run this program. (You can get it from
	<a href="http://www.java.com">www.java.com</a> )</li>
	<li>You need to be logged on to Steam
	so that some of Valve's SDK tools are operable.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What to click:</h3>

<p>To run the GUI double-click on
packbsp.exe.</p>

<h3>"Help! It shows me a list of files it
expects, do I really need to tell it where to find them all?"</h3>

	<p>To some extent you need to use your
	own judgment whether a missing asset is important. For example, .PHY
	files are only needed for solid props.</p>

<h3>Having problems?</h3>
