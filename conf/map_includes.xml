    Each "game" definition describes a set of includes which will be used, and
    may also reference a "parent" definition which will also be consulted.

    The naming convention "game:x" is used to designate games based on their
    name shown in the Source SDK, while "engine:x" is used to refer to shared
    features of engines which those games are based upon.
